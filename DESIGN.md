## Key Design Patterns

### Hooks own state domains

| Hook | Domain |
|---|---|
| `useCountryStore` | Country CRUD, My List, favorites, visited |
| `useTripStore` | Trip group management |
| `useAiPlanStore` | AI plan persistence (save/replace/compare) |
| `useChatSession` | LLM chat state machine (messages, finalize, tokens) |
| `useCountryRule` | Lazy-loading and caching consolidated per-country rule JSON |
| `usePersistedSet` | Reusable `Set<string>` + localStorage (DRY); reconciles cross-tab via `storage` events |
| `useHashView` | URL hash routing |
| `useBreakpoint` | Responsive breakpoint state |
| `useInstallPrompt` | PWA install prompt capture, installed-in-browser detection (`getInstalledRelatedApps`) + `openApp`, iOS detection |
| `useItineraryShare` | Country/itinerary share: native PDF file (lazy jsPDF) → native text → clipboard |
| `usePanelDrag` | Resizable country panel behavior |

No Redux, no context providers. `App.tsx` calls hooks and passes results as props.

### Core/web split

`src/core/` owns reusable domain logic, storage-backed state, and pure utilities. Web-facing code depends on core via relative imports, while adapter seams (`StoragePort` + `WebStorageAdapter`) isolate browser persistence from the rest of the application.

### Seed + Overrides

User edits stored as full objects in `tp_customs`. On load, customs override seed entries by name; `tp_deleted` tombstones removed seeds. Applied to both countries and trip groups.

### Rule engine

```
useCountryRule(name) → import.meta.glob → data/rules/{name}.json (lazy, cached)
generateTripPlan(country, style, cities, days, rule)
  ├─ rule found → per-day activities, costs, hotels, routes from rule data
  └─ no rule   → generic algorithm fallback for resilience/custom entries
```

All 198 manifest destinations currently ship with offline rule JSON coverage, but the generic fallback remains as a safety net.

### City selection & day allocation (`citySelection.ts`)

When a rule-backed itinerary is generated for **D** days, the engine must decide
*which* cities to include and *how many* days each gets. This is solved optimally
with a **bounded-knapsack dynamic program**, not greedy heuristics:

```
scoreCities(rule)            → per-city importance from real signals:
                               recDays (0.5) + content depth days.length (0.3)
                               + route prominence (0.2)   [popularity proxy]
cityDayValue(bounds, days)   → concave satisfaction: 0 below min, 0.7× at min,
                               1.0× at recDays, 1.15× at max (diminishing returns)
planItinerary(cities, D, …)  → DP over dp[t] = best value using exactly t days;
                               reconstructs allocation, fills exactly D when
                               feasible, else the fullest reachable trip
```

- **Concavity** makes the DP spread days across more worthwhile cities rather than
  over-stuffing one, while still filling the requested trip length.
- `includeAll: true` (used when the user hand-picks cities) keeps every city and
  only allocates days; auto mode may drop low-value cities to fit a tight budget.
- Below-minimum budgets fall back to the single most valuable city (or all cities
  at their minimum when inclusion is forced), so callers always get a usable plan.
- Complexity **O(n·D·R)** — trivial at real scale (n≈4–8, D≤~40). Correctness is
  guarded by a brute-force optimality test.

Editing a country's **travel style** re-seeds the default day count via
`defaultDaysForStyle()` (touch-and-go ≈ 60% recDays, explorer = recDays,
immersive = maxDays); the day slider then feeds `planItinerary`.

### Feature flags

Two-tier gating lives in `src/core/featureFlags.ts`. Paid features require both `paidFeatures=true` and the individual flag to be enabled.

| Flag | Default | Tier | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `paidFeatures` | `false` | system | Master gate for premium features |
| `llmPlanning` | `true` | paid | AI trip planning flow |
| `pdfExport` | `true` | paid | PDF export from itinerary views |
| `searchableHomeCountry` | `false` | free | Searchable home-country picker |

### Portal pattern

Filter dropdowns, tooltips, and experience picker use `createPortal` to avoid clipping from scroll/overflow containers in header and panel layouts.

### App header layout

- Primary header keeps navigation + lightweight app actions only: brand, view navigation, and a slim right cluster of **Share app · Settings (⚙️) · Dev flag panel (dev-only)** plus a conditional **Install app** button.
- The install slot is context-aware: it shows **Install app** when the browser offers `beforeinstallprompt` (or iOS A2HS guidance), and swaps to a best-effort **Open app** action once `navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps()` reports the PWA is already installed but running in a browser tab. Nothing shows when running standalone.
- App-wide defaults (home country, default budget party size) live inside **Settings → General**, not in the header — this declutters the top bar and gives those controls a stable, discoverable home.
- Progress/count telemetry (favorites, visited, total) belongs to Trips page context instead of global top bar.
- Mobile keeps the same model via hamburger utility drawer with compact icon-based actions (Share/Install/Open + Settings + Dev).

### Trips responsive control layout

`TripsView` keeps one filter model but adapts presentation by breakpoint:
- **Mobile**: compact header row with icon-triggered primary/secondary filter panels
- **Tablet/Desktop**: left filter rail (primary Month/Budget/Visited + a collapsible **Trip filters** disclosure for secondary type/status/region + stats) that can itself be collapsed, with right-side results toolbar (filter toggle, search, icon-only list/grid, sort, count, new trip). The secondary disclosure is collapsed by default (auto-expands when any secondary filter is active) so the default rail stays scannable — progressive disclosure mirrors the mobile filter sheet
- **Card invariant**: Trips renders one card per country in My List (trip groups annotate cards but do not suppress standalone country cards)
- **Narrow mobile**: forced list view; wider phones can switch list/grid
- **Popularity sort**: driven by country `popularityScore` sourced from manifest metadata (calibrated to a 1-100 **leisure-only** composite across all 198 destinations: experiences 35% + city depth 20% + seasonality 20% + affordability/value 15% + combo breadth 5% + landmark presence 5%; no arrivals/receipts/work-business inputs), then favorites, then name
- **Experience tags**: experience selection is **panel-local only** — the country panel's Plan tab owns a `selectedExperiences` state that shapes just that country's offline itinerary (city-score boost in auto-selection + experience-first activity ordering per day). There is no global/app-level experience filter; Trips and Calendar never filter by experience
- **Search ranking behavior**: primary-country matches (including word-prefix matches) rank above combine/related hits; fuzzy fallback is strict and only used when deterministic matching finds nothing; active search keeps relevance order (no popularity re-sort)
- **Results context strip**: desktop results toolbar shows sort + budget-basis context and provides a one-click clear-all reset
- **Compact card rhythm**: grid cards reserve combo-row space and render a low-emphasis "No combo yet" placeholder when suggestions are absent, keeping progress rows aligned
- **List card de-duplication**: combo cards no longer repeat add-ons inline in the header; add-on countries are shown once in the chip row
- **Budget-basis cue**: list card budget chips display the active basis icon (solo/couple/family4) so shown values are unambiguous

### Budget basis (party size)

- **Single source of truth**: `src/core/utils/budget.ts` owns the `BudgetBasis` type (`solo`/`couple`/`family4`), `DEFAULT_BUDGET_BASIS` (`couple`), basis meta (icon/label/long), `budgetForBasis(country, basis)` (per-basis lookup with fallback to the single `budget` string), and `deriveBudgetBreakdown(solo)` (scales a per-person range into couple/family totals via `BASIS_MULTIPLIER` — couple 1.77×, family4 3.45×, calibrated from the median ratios across all 198 rule-backed destinations). `filterLogic` re-exports `BudgetBasis` and reuses the helper.
- **Two-layer state** (`useBudgetBasis`): a persisted **global default** (`tp_budget_basis`) plus a transient in-session **active** value seeded from it. `setGlobalBasis` persists and resets active to it; `setActiveBasis` is temporary (not persisted). A corrupt stored value is guarded by `isBudgetBasis` and falls back to `couple`.
- **Controls**: **Settings → General** hosts the app-wide defaults — the home-country selector and a `BudgetBasisPills` segmented control (`variant="light"`, with label) bound to the **global** default. The Trips toolbar pill edits only the **active** value (quick "play around"), and the Trips clear-all resets active to the global default.
- **Consumers of active basis**: Trips filtering/cards, `CountryPanel` (budget chips + plan generation), `CalendarView` budget cue. The App threads `activeBasis` to each.
- **Header budget strip vs plan cost**: `PanelHeader`'s "Typical budget" strip (`getBudgetBadges`) is a **static full-trip reference** — it shows all three party sizes at once and does NOT react to the day slider or active basis (labeled with an ⓘ tooltip clarifying this). The **live** figure that follows selected days + active basis is the Plan tab cost from `generateTripPlan`.
- **Cost model**: `generateTripPlan(..., basis)` computes plan cost from `budgetForBasis(country, basis)` scaled by `days / recommendedDays` (floor 0.2), so at the recommended length the plan cost equals that basis's budget chip. The resulting `TripPlan.costBasis` records the party basis; `planCostBasisIcon` renders the basis icon (👤/👫/👨‍👩‍👧‍👦) beside the cost, with `planCostBasisLabel` supplying an accessible `title`/`aria-label` (never shown as visible text). AI plans omit `costBasis` and fall back to the 👤 (per-person) icon.

### Country panel interactions

- **Three tabs** (`PANEL_TABS`, `panelTab` state = `overview` | `plan` | `notes`). The former **Info tab is merged into Overview**: decision content (Trip readiness, When to go, Stopover tip, Watch out for, Combine with) is followed by the research group — `LearnAboutSection`, `PlanningResourcesSection`, `UsefulLinksSection` (all in `panel/InfoSections.tsx`). These are lazy collapsibles (`LearnAboutSection` fetches only on expand; the shared `ExternalLinkIcon` is reused across link rows), so the merge adds no eager network and keeps Overview short at rest.
- Header flag rendering uses explicit aliases plus locale region-name resolution and now covers all manifest country names.
- “Combine with” pills are interactive and open the selected country panel — resolving from My List, the seed/custom set, or the catalog — so related destinations open even when not yet added. The panel merges loaded rule data (`mergeCountryData`) over the resolved country, so a not-yet-tracked target still shows full budget/months/experiences/itinerary.
- **Edit form** (`CountryForm`): budget is edited as a **single per-person (solo) field**; couple and family4 totals are derived via `deriveBudgetBreakdown` and shown as read-only icon hints, then written to `Country.budgetBreakdown`. The single `budget` string stays synced to the derived couple value (enrichment convention). Travel style is **single-select** and drives the default day count. `getBudgetBadges` prefers the country's `budgetBreakdown` override over raw rule data, so edits are reflected in the member chips.
- **In-place refresh**: saving updates React state only (no reload). The panel's identity-reset effect keys on `country.name`, and a separate effect re-seeds the day slider from `travelStyle`/rule bounds — so editing budget alone preserves an in-progress plan, while editing style re-seeds the default pacing in place.

### Cinematic map

Reuses the main MapLibre instance via `mainMapRef`. Disables user interaction on mount, adds GeoJSON route sources, animates fly-through with rAF, restores on close.

Playback controls are ref-backed so the imperative animation reads live values without re-running the effect:
- **Pause** (`pausedRef`) — halts rAF ticks and dwell loops.
- **Speed** (`speedRef`, 1× / 1.5× / 2×) — divides every `rafAnimate` duration, `sleep`, `flyTo`/`flyAndWait` duration, and dwell hold, keeping camera flights and route-draw in sync.
- **Skip** (`skipActiveRef` flag) — fast-forwards every segment (`rafAnimate` snaps `onProgress(1)`, skip-aware `sleep`/hold loops resolve, `flyTo`→`jumpTo`) until the next city arrival, where it auto-clears and normal playback resumes. Idempotent, so rapid clicks simply advance more stops without state drift.
- **Prev** (`jumpToRef` target + `runId` replay) — the fly-through is forward-only, so stepping back re-runs the effect from the start with skip active and stops fast-forwarding only once the arrival index reaches the target. `savedViewRef` preserves the true pre-cinematic camera across replays, and `cityPhotoMap` is merged (not overwritten) so photos survive a replay.

## Data Model

### Country data tiers

| Tier | Source | Count | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Catalog** | `data/worldCatalog.json` | 197 | `{ name, lat, lng, region }` — Discover view |
| **Manifest** | `data/rules/index.json` | 198 | Browse metadata + `inSeed`, `hasItinerary`, `recDays`, `maxDays`, `popularityScore` |
| **Rule JSON** | `data/rules/{name}.json` | 198 | Consolidated country data + day-by-day itinerary rules |

The Discover catalog remains a 197-country sovereign browse list. The manifest expands coverage to 198 itinerary-backed destinations, and curated starter destinations are identified via `inSeed` for first-run My List population.

### Core types

```ts
type Country = {
  name: string;
  lat: number; lng: number;
  bestMonths: string[];
  worstMonths?: string[];
  budget: string;              // "₹3L–₹5L" (display fallback)
  budgetBreakdown?: { solo: string; couple: string; family4: string };
  experiences: string[];
  avoid?: string[];
  combo?: string[];
  landmark?: string;           // Wikipedia title for hover image
  travelStyle?: TravelStyle[];
  cities?: CityEntry[];
  stopoverNote?: string;
  links?: { label: string; url: string }[];
  notes?: string;
};

type TripGroupDef = {
  main: string;
  addOns: string[];
  region: Region;
};

type LLMTripPlanResult = {
  destinationName: string;
  originCountry: string;
  travelers: number;
  durationDays: number;
  budgetLevel: "budget" | "mid-range" | "luxury";
  assumptions: string[];
  cities: LLMCityInfo[];
  meta: LLMDestinationMeta;
  plan: LLMTripPlan;
};
```

## Persistence

All keys live in `src/core/lsKeys.ts` — never hardcode strings.

| Key | Content |
|---|---|
| `tp_my_list` | Country names in user's list |
| `tp_visited` | Visited country names |
| `tp_favorites` | Favorited country names |
| `tp_customs` | User-added/edited Country objects |
| `tp_deleted` | Tombstoned seed country names |
| `tp_home_country` | Departure country (default: "India") |
| `tp_budget_basis` | Persisted global budget party size (default: "couple") |
| `tp_trip_customs` | User-created/edited trip groups |
| `tp_trip_deleted` | Tombstoned seed trip groups |
| `tp_features` | Feature flag overrides |
| `tp_llm_keys` | LLM API keys per provider |
| `tp_llm_provider` | Active LLM provider |
| `tp_ai_plans` | Saved AI plans (max 3 per destination) |
| `tp_last_backup` | ISO timestamp of last backup |
| `tp_backup_frequency` | Reminder cadence: daily / weekly / never |
| `tp_backup_schedule` | Backup reminder schedule metadata |
| `tp_backup_target` | Platform backup destination override (`filesystem`/`opfs`/`download`) |
| `tp_fre_done` | First-run experience completed/dismissed flag |
| `tp_schema_version` | Persisted-data schema version (see Schema migrations) |

### Schema migrations

`src/core/migrations.ts` owns forward-compatible persistence upgrades:

- `SCHEMA_VERSION` is the current on-disk shape version (baseline `1`).
- `MIGRATIONS` is an **append-only, ordered** registry of `{ version, description, migrate }`. Each entry upgrades data _to_ its `version`.
- `runMigrations()` is called once in `main.tsx` **before any hook reads storage**. It applies every pending migration in ascending order, then stamps `tp_schema_version`. It never throws — a failed migration is logged and boot continues (hooks still fall back to defaults via `loadLS`).
- Pre-versioning stores (data present, no version key) are treated as the v1 baseline and simply stamped — no transform, because the shipped shapes _are_ v1.
- To evolve a shape: bump `SCHEMA_VERSION`, append a `Migration` with the new version, and add tests in `src/test/migrations.test.ts`.

### Platform-aware backup targets

Auto-backup is routed to a **capability-based** destination so app data stays findable and restorable per device (one PWA codebase, no desktop/mobile fork):

- `src/core/platform/platformProfile.ts` — pure `detectPlatformProfile(env)` (OS, form-factor, surface, capability flags: File System Access / OPFS / share-files / persistent-storage) + memoized `getPlatformProfile()`. iPadOS (desktop UA + touch points) is classified as iOS.
- `src/core/platform/defaults.ts` — `resolvePlatformDefaults()` chooses a `BackupTargetKind`: desktop prefers `filesystem` (a folder the user picks once, browsable in the OS file manager); mobile prefers silent `opfs`; both fall back to `download`. `autoImport` is enabled only for readable targets.
- `src/core/ports/BackupTargetPort.ts` + `src/core/adapters/backup/*` — swappable targets implementing `write` / `readLatest` / `configure` / `location`. Every persistent target stores data inside a dedicated `Roamwise/` app folder (created on demand via the shared `appDir.ts` helper) as a stable `roamwise-backup-latest.json`, so backups are grouped and re-readable. Filesystem persists the chosen `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` in IndexedDB (`handleStore.ts`) and re-verifies read/write permission.
- `src/utils/backup.ts` — `backupToTarget()` requests `navigator.storage.persist()` then writes via the active target (falling back to a download if not ready); `autoBackupToTargetIfOverdue()`, `restoreFromTarget()`, `canAutoImport()`, `hasAnyLocalData()`, and `getBackupTargetKind`/`setBackupTargetKind` support the flow.
- `App.tsx` — on mount, backs up overdue data, or on a fresh/empty device **offers** (never silently applies) a one-click restore when a backup is readable. Settings → Backup shows the active location and controls via `StorageLocationCard`.

## Code Flows

### Offline plan generation
```
CountryPanel → generateTripPlan(country, style, cities, days, rule, basis, experiences)
  → rule engine (experience-aware: boosts matching cities + orders day activities) or generic fallback
  → TripPlan { duration, costPerPerson, days[], note }
  → PlanPreview → Cinematic / Itinerary / PDF / 🗺️ Route
```

### AI plan flow
```
CountryPanel "Plan with AI" → ChatModal (pre-filled prompt)
  → LLM conversation → "Finish & Generate" → extract JSON
  → AiItineraryModal → save/replace comparison
  → useAiPlanStore → appears in CountryPanel dropdown
```

### Import flow
```
ChatModal ImportView → paste text or share link
  → parseImportedText() (JSON → structured → chat extraction)
  → preview + prompt suggestions
  → AiItineraryModal → save/replace
```

## Validation

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit    # type check
npm test            # vitest
npm run build       # tsc + vite build
```

Reusable coverage slash command:
- `/tc-improvement <scope>` uses the local `tc-improvement` Copilot skill to execute phased coverage work (integration risk-first -> unit/component depth -> threshold hardening).

### Testing expansion plan (Phase 1)

- Added App-orchestration integration coverage for browser-state hydration and hash-route transitions.
- Added shared test utilities in `src/test/testUtils.ts` for:
  - deterministic localStorage seeding
  - hash-route setup
  - deterministic timer control for timing-sensitive UI tests
- Current threshold policy remains strict for domain logic (`core/utils`, hooks, utils) and intentionally permissive for broad UI shells (`src/components/**`) until additional integration coverage lands.
- **Hard commit gate:** a global floor of **89% statements/lines** is enforced by `vitest run --coverage` (thresholds in `vite.config.ts`), wired into both the pre-commit hook and `npm run validate`. Commits are blocked below 89%. Backup targets are tested against a reusable fake File System (`src/test/support/fakeFileSystem.ts`) covering permissions, the dedicated `Roamwise/` app folder, and read/write round-trips.

### Testing expansion plan (Phase 2 complete)

- Expanded App orchestration integration tests to cover:
  - default-hash fallback to Trips and route switching across top-level views
  - cross-view country selection wiring into `CountryPanel`
  - filter-state interaction effect on Calendar vs Trips pipelines
  - feature-flag-driven AI prop wiring at the top shell boundary
  - Discover add/remove callback wiring into country-store pathways

### Coverage-improvement agent model

Use a phased execution model for coverage work:
1. **Phase 1 (Integration risk-first):** lock critical journeys and known regression paths.
2. **Phase 2 (Component/unit depth):** cover branch-heavy logic inside touched modules.
3. **Phase 3 (Threshold hardening):** raise/verify thresholds only after stable behavioral coverage.

Per phase:
- add tests in small batches,
- keep deterministic mocks for timer/network/storage behavior,
- run full quality gates (`tsc`, `test`, `build`) before advancing.

## Performance

- **Code-splitting**: Heavy modals/overlays are lazy-loaded via `React.lazy()` + `Suspense` (~123 KB deferred from initial bundle): `ChatModal`, `ItineraryCinematic`, `SettingsModal`, `AiItineraryModal`, `FreTour`, `CountryForm`, `ItineraryModal`, `PlanCompareModal`
- **Idle-time enrichment**: `useCountryStore` enriches seed countries in `requestIdleCallback` chunks of 10 — first paint renders instantly with minimal seed objects, cards progressively hydrate. Non-seed countries added to My List (e.g. India, `inSeed: false`) are also enriched on demand from their rule JSON, so any tracked destination shows real budget/months/experiences — My List is the source of truth, independent of the seed set. Bare catalog stubs are transparently upgraded to enriched data in `buildCountryList` without discarding user edits.
- **Rule lazy-loading**: 199 JSON files in `data/rules/` loaded on demand via `import.meta.glob`, cached at module level in `useCountryRule`
- **Memoization**: `useMemo` across `App.tsx`, `useCountryStore`, `TripsView`, `CountryPanel` (month sets/grid), and `ItineraryModal` (day grouping)
- **Stale update guards**: `useCountryRule` + `fetchCountryInfo` discard results when selection changes before the fetch resolves

## Tailwind Conventions

- Text: labels `text-[10px]`, body `text-[11px]`/`text-xs`, headings `text-sm`/`text-base`
- Rounded: cards `rounded-xl`, chips `rounded-full`, inputs `rounded-lg`
- Spacing: section gaps `space-y-5`, inner card `space-y-3.5`
- Custom keyframes live in `src/index.css` (currently 8), not Tailwind config
